/*
 * This component emulates the activity and role of a dopaminergic neuron.
 * It is not a leaky integrator like a neuron. It simply takes input from
 * the critic module and the output of the network (in the form of inhibition),
 * and updates the weights of specific synapses.
 *
 * see Kurzawa et al., Neural Computation 29, 1â€“26 (2017)
 *
 * As an alternative mechanism, consider that the critic module can
 * inform the modulator of a reward or punishment, and the modulator
 * can change synapses by making them Hebbian or anti-Hebbian, depending on
 * whether a reward or punishment was administered.
